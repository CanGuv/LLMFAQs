# LLM fine-tuning and integration

## Description
In this project, a pre-trained LLM is fine-tuned on a specific dataset. When a user enters a question, the model outputs the most relevant questions (with its answers) from the dataset, which will help answering the user's question.

## Folder Structure
- **src/**: Contains Python scripts and related README that explains the scripts and their usage.
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebook for fine-tuning an LLM, along with a README for notebook specifics.
